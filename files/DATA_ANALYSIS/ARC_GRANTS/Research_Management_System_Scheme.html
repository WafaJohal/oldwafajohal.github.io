 resolution health assessment of Antarctic plants as climate changes. 
Declines in terrestrial ecosystem health as a result of a drying climate
 have been observed in some areas of East Antarctica. This project aims 
to determine if such changes are widespread. Since mosses, the dominant 
plants of Antarctica, preserve a record of past climate down their 
shoots they can be used as surrogates to study how both ecosystems and 
climate are changing at remote polar sites. Outcomes will include 
improved climate data for Antarctica, enabling more robust analysis of 
regional climate change, and development of ultrahigh-resolution 
techniques capable of non-destructively monitoring Antarctic ecosystem 
health. This research will advance ecosystem science and inform best 
practice in management of Antarctic biodiversity.</td><td class="dc-table-column _3">04/12/2019</td><td class="dc-table-column _4">University of Wollongong</td><td class="dc-table-column _5">0501</td><td class="dc-table-column _6">$505,000.00</td></tr><tr class="dc-table-row"><td class="dc-table-column _0">DP200100210</td><td class="dc-table-column _1">Professor Nalini Joshi; Dr Milena Radnovic</td><td class="dc-table-column _2">Geometric

proposal is devoted to linear and nonlinear harmonic analysis. It aims 
to unify the most significant attributes of harmonic analysis such as 
restriction estimates, dispersive properties of differential operators, 
spectral multipliers, uniform Sobolev estimates and sharp Weyl formula. 
Such unification will strongly improve tools for mathematical modelling 
in all areas of technology and science. Notable applications include 
medical imaging, fluid dynamics and subatomic modelling using quantum 
interpretation.
It will solve several important open problems in spectral analysis of 
partial differential operators and develop new cutting-edge techniques 
in harmonic analysis with application to nonlinear partial differential 
equations.</td><td class="dc-table-column _3">04/12/2019</td><td class="dc-table-column _4">Macquarie University</td><td class="dc-table-column _5">0101</td><td class="dc-table-column _6">$420,000.00</td></tr><tr class="dc-table-row"><td class="dc-table-column _0">DP200101049</td><td class="dc-table-column _1">Professor Dirk Kroese; Professor Jerzy Filar; Dr Nan Ye; Dr Hanna Kurniawati; Dr Martin Bohner</td><td class="dc-table-column _2">Partially

the high currents needed to move skyrmions. Magnonics is yet another

This proposal aims to use genetic and cell biological analysis of the

Significance:
This gene is conserved in all animal species and appears to be a master 
regulator of epithelial tissue development but it is unclear how it can 
both influence stem cell maintenance and production of functional cell 
types.
Expected outcomes:
We will identify a new mechanism that governs tissue development, and 
introduce new imaging and genetic technologies to the Australian

Benefit:
We expect potential economic and commercial interest in development of 
new gene analysis tools and biotechnological tissue manipulation

the object detection accuracy in real-world applications. A number of 
innovative methods for deep learning, contextual features and network 
parameter selection will be developed and investigated. The impact of 
the proposed architecture and features will be improved object-detection
 accuracy and advances in deep learning network architecture for image 
parsing. The intended outcomes are deep learning network architecture, 
contextual feature extraction techniques and network parameter 
optimisation techniques for image parsing.</td><td class="dc-table-column _3">04/12/2019</td><td class="dc-table-column _4">Central Queensland University</td><td class="dc-table-column _5">0801</td><td class="dc-table-column _6">$480,000.00</td></tr><tr class="dc-table-row"><td class="dc-table-column _0">DP200103398</td><td class="dc-table-column _1">Professor John Long; Professor Shaun Collin; Professor Richard Cloutier</td><td class="dc-table-column _2">Brains

Hexavalent chromium is a cancer-causing toxin.  It can form via heating

 fire-impacted soil. Using a combination of field-based investigations,

 Oxidase to Optimise Plant Growth and Stress Tolerance. Biomass 
accumulation in plants is the balance of CO2 fixed into carbohydrates 
through photosynthesis and carbohydrate burned (respired), ~ 50% of 
fixed CO2, to fuel growth. Plants possess energy conserving and 
non-conserving respiratory pathways. The alternative energy 
non-conserving pathway appears wasteful but is necessary for plant 
tolerance to adverse growth conditions. Our research has achieved 
modification of the alternative respiratory pathway that positively 
impacts plant growth. We will dissect the mechanism(s) of how the 
alternative respiratory pathway stimulates growth, from a molecular

This innovative study will extend the application of computational

 Anticipated outcomes and benefits include a paradigm shift in knowledge

aversive. This project aims to identify the determinants of human 
attitudes towards conflictive uncertainty. The aims will be achieved via
