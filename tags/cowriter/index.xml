      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly 8% of children between 4 and 12 are dysgraphic or encounter serious difficulties in learning handwriting. Dysgraphia, just like dyslexia, can seriously impair the everyday school life of children and have damageable impact on their academic achievements. The detection of such difficulties should be done as soon as possible to minimize its effect on the child’s school performances. And an adaptive remediation should be provided. The CHILI Lab at EPFL showed how a robotic co-learner agent could have positive effects on the child&amp;rsquo;s motivation to practice handwriting. However, motivation is only one aspect that needs to be taken into account in order to provide a long-term adaptive training experience for children learning how to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the iReCHeCk project, we propose a finer characterization of handwriting, as a multimodal activity, taking into account the body posture to capture important features in the handwriting process. We will develop engaging training activities with a robot to monitor the learning status of the child, allowing therapists to evaluate progresses, while adapting the robot&amp;rsquo;s attitude and the training task to the needs of the learner. Our goal being to touch a wide range of handwriting learners, these activities will be tested on two populations: Typically Developed Children that are learning how to write at school; Children with Neuro-Developmental Disorders, presenting handwriting difficulties along with other disorders (i.e. attentional, autistic).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Behavioural Analysis in HRI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the field of human-robot interaction (HRI) as in many other technical fields, an innumerable number of different
metrics to analyze the interaction can be found in as many studies. Even-though many of these metrics are not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;comparable between studies, we observe that the research community in HRI, but also in many other
research domain, is starting to seek for reproducibility [10]; a consensus begins to appear concerning
common measures that can be used across a wide range of studies. In social HRI, the evaluation of
the quality of an interaction is complex because it is very task dependent. However, certain metrics
such as engagement seem to well reflect the quality of interactions between a robot agent and the
human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of acceptability of a robot is the home environment in which it is to be able to perceive when it will be
solicited. The goal for the robot is to not disturb the user and to be able to predict that it will be solicited. This is
something we do all the time as humans (we can see a street vendor approaching us and we know they will talk
to us). The process for us human relies on proxemics (speed and angle of approach) but not only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my work on modeling engagement [11, 12], I used multi-modal data to train a SVM to detect engagement. We&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;collected data from various sensors embedded in the Kompai robot and reduced the number of crucial features
from 32 to 7. Interestingly shoulder orientation and position of the face in the image are among these crucial
features. If we transpose these features to what humans do, these features seem coherent with behavioral
analysis.
The previous model aimed to predict the engagement, but once the user is engaged, it is important to evaluate its
attitude and mood. Using the COST and HAART dataset, we trained a model to detect social touch. Together with
colleagues, we won the Social Touch Challenge at ICMI 2015 improving the gestures recognition from 60% accuracy
to 70% training a Random Forest Model. [13]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;project-summary&#34;&gt;Project Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research occurred in a special context where Kazakhstan’s recent decision to switch from Cyrillic to the Latin-based alphabet has resulted in challenges connected with teaching literacy, addressing a rare combination of research hypotheses and technical objectives about language learning. Teachers are not necessarily trained to teach the new alphabet, and this could result in a harder challenge for children with difficulties. Prior research studies in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) have proposed the use of a robot to teach handwriting to children. Drawing on the Kazakhstani case, our study takes an interdisciplinary approach by bringing together smart solutions from robotics, computer vision areas and educational frameworks, language and cognitive studies that will benefit diverse groups of stakeholders. In the first study, a human-robot interaction application is designed to help primary school children learn both a newly-adopted script and also its handwriting system. The setup involved an experiment with 62 children between the ages of seven to nine years old, across three conditions: a robot and a tablet, a tablet only, and a teacher. Based on the paradigm &amp;ndash; learning by teaching &amp;ndash; the study showed that children improved their knowledge of the Latin script by interacting with a robot. Findings reported that children gained similar knowledge of a new script in all three conditions without gender effect. In addition, children&amp;rsquo;s likeability ratings and positive mood change scores demonstrate significant benefits favoring the robot over a traditional teacher and tablet only approaches. This work is published in a Frontiers in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence journal. This work was conducted in the capital of Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively little is known about the transfer of writing skills across scripts and it is extremely difficult to isolate the role of motor skills in this transfer, as compared to other cognitive and linguistic skills. Since handwriting combines visual, language, and motor dimensions, neuroimaging does not provide a clear account of cerebral substrates of handwriting.  A recent change of policy in Kazakhstan gave us an opportunity to measure transfer, as the Latin-based Kazakh alphabet has not yet been introduced. With the aim to understand if the script change of the Kazakh language from Cyrillic to Latin would have an effect on handwriting performance of young children and potentially increase the number of children with learning disabilities such as dyslexia and dysgraphia, we investigated the transfer of handwriting skills (from Cyrillic to Latin) in primary school children. To this end, we conducted an analysis of children’s handwriting dynamic data in both scripts (acquired from 200 children aged 6-11 years old who were asked to write a short text on a digital tablet using its stylus) in order to identify if the number of years spent practicing Cyrillic has an effect on the quality of handwriting in the Latin alphabet. The results showed that some of the differences between the two scripts were constant across all grades. These differences thus reflect the intrinsic differences in the handwriting dynamics between the two alphabets. For instance, several features related to the pen pressure on the tablet are quite different.  Other features, however, revealed decreasing differences between the two scripts across grades. While we found that the quality of Cyrillic writing increased from grades 1 to 4, due to increased practice, we also found that the quality of the Latin writing increased as well, despite the fact that all of the pupils had the same absence of experience in writing in Latin. We can therefore interpret this improvement in Latin script as an indicator of the transfer of fine motor control skills from Cyrillic to Latin. This result is especially surprising given that one could instead hypothesize a negative transfer, i.e., that the finger controls automated for one alphabet would interfere with those required by the other alphabet. This work is accepted to a prestigious npj Science of Learning journal. This work was conducted in both locations: data collection was conducted in the school in Kazakhstan, while data analysis was conducted in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deliverables&#34;&gt;Deliverables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We proposed the first dataset for handwriting recognition of Cyrillic-based languages such as Kazakh and Russian, which is appropriate for the use by machine learning approaches. It contains 121,234 samples of 42 Cyrillic letters. The performance of Cyrillic-MNIST is evaluated using standard deep learning approaches and is compared to the Extended MNIST (EMNIST) dataset. The dataset is available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bolattleubayev/cmnist&#34;&gt;https://github.com/bolattleubayev/cmnist&lt;/a&gt;. This work is under review in Frontiers in Big Data journal. It was conducted in Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We implemented an autonomous social robot that would assist and motivate children in transition from the old Cyrillic alphabet to a new Latin alphabet. The hardware components of the system include a humanoid NAO robot and a tablet with a stylus. The software components of the CoWriting Kazakh system include: a) handwriting recognition of Cyrillic languages trained on over 120,000 samples of the Cyrillic-MNIST dataset; b) Learning by Demonstration (LbD) in robot font to dynamically adapt to each child&amp;rsquo;s individual handwriting style where trajectories of human handwriting are collected in real time; c) Latin-to-Latin Learning by Teaching (LbT): a humanoid robot plays a unique social role and asks for help to learn Kazakh language but since it cannot read Cyrillic script, a child becomes robot&amp;rsquo;s teacher who is committed to try her best to write the words in Latin so that the robot can read and learn Kazakh. Such an approach allows us to keep a child engaged in the learning process that we utilized in the experiment with 67 children. The system was submitted as a demonstration paper titled “CoWriting Kazakh: Learning a new script with a robot - Demonstration”. This demonstration got the “Best Demonstration” award at the prestigious HRI 2020 conference. This work was conducted in Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;
