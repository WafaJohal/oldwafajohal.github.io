	abstract = {In recent years, robots have been surfing on a trendy wave as standard devices for teaching programming. The tangibility of robotics platforms allows for collaborative and interactive learning. Moreover, with these robot platforms, we also observe the occurrence of a shift of visual attention from the screen (on which the programming is done) to the physical environments (i.e. the robot). In this paper, we describe an experiment aiming at studying the effect of using augmented reality ({AR}) representations of sensor data in a robotic learning activity. We designed an {AR} system able to display in real-time the data of the Infra-Red sensors of the Thymio robot. In order to evaluate the impact of {AR} on the learner's understanding on how these sensors worked, we designed a pedagogical lesson that can run with or without the {AR} rendering. Two different age groups of students participated in this between-subject experiment, counting a total of 74 children. The tests were the same for the experimental ({AR}) and control group (no {AR}). The exercises differed only through the use of {AR}. Our results show that {AR} was worth being used for younger groups dealing with difficult concepts. We discuss our findings and propose future works to establish guidelines for designing {AR} robotic learning sessions.},

	abstract = {In this article, we investigate the role of interactive haptic-enabled tangible robots in supporting the learning of cursive letter writing for children with attention and visuomotor coordination issues. We focus on the two principal aspects of handwriting that are linked to these issues: Visual perception and visuomotor coordination. These aspects respectively enhance two features of letter representation in the learner's mind in particular, namely the shape (grapheme) and the dynamics (ductus) of the letter, which constitute the central learning goals in our activity. Building upon an initial design tested with 17 healthy children in a preliminary school, we iteratively ported the activity to an occupational therapy context in 2 different therapy centers, in the context of 3 different summer school camps involving a total of 12 children having writing difficulties. The various iterations allowed us to uncover insights about the design of robot-enhanced writing activities for special education, specifically highlighting the importance of ease of modification of the duration of an activity as well as of adaptable frequency, content, flow, and game-play and of providing a range of evaluation test alternatives. Results show that the use of robot-assisted handwriting activities could have a positive impact on the learning of the representation of letters in the context of occupational therapy (V = 1449, p {\textless} 0.001, r=0.42). Results also highlight how the design changes made across the iterations affected the outcomes of the handwriting sessions, such as the evaluation of the performances, monitoring of the performances, and the connectedness of the handwriting.},

This emphasizes the development of strategies to further healthy ageing. One important aspect of good health in later life stages is sustained skilled motor function. Objective: Here, we tested the effectiveness of robotic upper limb motor training in a game-like scenario assessing game-based learning and its transfer potential. Methods: Thirty-six healthy participants (n = 18 elderly participants, n = 18 young controls) trained with a Pacman-like game using a hand-held Cellulo robot on two consecutive days. The game-related movements were conducted on a printed map displaying a maze and targets that had to be collected. Gradually, the task difficulty was adjusted between games by modifying or adding different game elements (e.g., speed and number of chasing ghosts, additional rules, haptic feedback). Transfer was assessed by scoring simple robot manipulation on two different trajectories. Results: Elderly participants were able to improve their game performance over time (t(874) = 2.97, p {\textless} .01). The applied game-elements had similar effects on both age groups. Importantly, the game-based learning transferred to simple robot manipulation, which resembles activities of daily life. Only minor age-related differences were present (smaller overall learning gain, different effect of the wall crash penalty rule in the elderly group). Conclusions: Gamified motor training with the Cellulo system has the potential to translate into an efficient, relatively low-cost robotic motor training tool for promoting upper limb function to promote healthy aging.},

ABSTRACT={This research occurred in a special context where Kazakhstan's recent decision to switch from Cyrillic to the Latin-based alphabet has resulted in challenges connected to teaching literacy, addressing a rare combination of research hypotheses and technical objectives about language learning. Teachers are not necessarily trained to teach the new alphabet, and this could result in a challenge for children with learning difficulties. Prior research studies in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) have proposed the use of a robot to teach handwriting to children (Hood et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2015</xref>; Lemaignan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2016</xref>). Drawing on the Kazakhstani case, our study takes an interdisciplinary approach by bringing together smart solutions from robotics, computer vision areas, and educational frameworks, language, and cognitive studies that will benefit diverse groups of stakeholders. In this study, a human-robot interaction application is designed to help primary school children learn both a newly-adopted script and also its handwriting system. The setup involved an experiment with 62 children between the ages of 7â€“9 years old, across three conditions: a robot and a tablet, a tablet only, and a teacher. Based on the paradigmâ€”learning by teachingâ€”the study showed that children improved their knowledge of the Latin script by interacting with a robot. Findings reported that children gained similar knowledge of a new script in all three conditions without gender effect. In addition, children's likeability ratings and positive mood change scores demonstrate significant benefits favoring the robot over a traditional teacher and tablet only approaches.}

This project aims to assess the distracting potential of robot faces based on their human-likeliness. As a first step, this paper reports on our initial findings based on an online study.
We used a letter search task where participants had to search for a target letter within a circle of 6 letters, whilst an irrelevant distractor image was also present. 
The results of our experiment replicated previous results with human faces and non-face objects. Additionally, in the tasks where the irrelevant distractors are images of robot faces, the human-likeness of the robot influenced the response time (RT). 
Interestingly, the robot Alter produced results significantly different than all other distractor robots. 
The outcome of this is a distraction model related to human-likeness of robots. Our results show the impact of anthropomorphism on distracting potential and thus should be taken into account when designing robots."},

After collecting a set of papers using a term search on the Scopus database, we analysed the content of these papers based on methodology (i.e., model, the dataset used), evaluation measures (i.e., objective and subjective) and limitations. The results indicate that data-driven approaches are used more frequently. In terms of evaluation measures, we found a trend of combining objective and subjective metrics, while no standards exist for either.

ABSTRACT={The evolving field of human-robot interaction (HRI) necessitates that we better understand how social robots operate and interact with humans. This scoping review provides an overview of about 300 research works focusing on the use of the NAO robot from 2010 to 2020. This study presents one of the most extensive and inclusive pieces of evidence on the deployment of the humanoid NAO robot and its global reach. Unlike most reviews, we provide both qualitative and quantitative results regarding how NAO is being used and what has been achieved so far. We analyzed a wide range of theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions that provide multidimensional insights, such as general trends in terms of application, the robot capabilities, its input and output modalities of communication, and the human-robot interaction experiments that featured NAO (e.g. number and roles of participants, design, and the length of interaction). Lastly, we derive from the review some research gaps in current state-of-the-art and provide suggestions for the design of the next generation of social robots.}

  abstract={The difficulty in maintaining attention can interfere with the acquisition of critical academic skills. Recently, researchers have used embodied and game-based learning to support skill acquisition for children with learning difficulties. In this context, robots can be an interesting asset to foster engagement and investigate game dynamics. However, it is still an open question of how to develop adaptive learning environments for children with learning difficulties. Before one can provide effective adaptation, a first step is needed to understand the differentiating behaviors during the activity for children with attention difficulties. Three such differentiating behaviors are how a child divides his or her attention during the learning activity, the childs level of cognitive load, and the childs physiological fatigue, which are the focus of our study Using a robot assisted, gamified activity, we conducted a user study with 18 children having difficulty in maintaining attention. Using process mining techniques and eye-tracking data, we found the importance of integrating the autonomous robots into the attention patterns to successfully complete a game and the influence their behaviors can have on the participants attention. This importance was supported by the cognitive load of participants decreasing the more they focused on the autonomous robots in successful games. This work contributes to the understanding of childrens behaviors during tangible game-based activities and can be used to build effective adaptation for children with attention difficulties.}

ABSTRACT={Education is one of the major application fields in social Human-Robot Interaction. Several forms of social robots have been explored to engage and assist students in the classroom environment, from full-bodied humanoid robots to tabletop robot companions, but flying robots have been left unexplored in this context. In this paper, we present seven online remote workshops conducted with 20 participants to investigate the application area of Education in the Human-Drone Interaction domain; particularly focusing on what roles a social drone could fulfill in a classroom, how it would interact with students, teachers and its environment, what it could look like, and what would specifically differ from other types of social robots used in education. In the workshops we used online collaboration tools, supported by a sketch artist, to help envision a social drone in a classroom. The results revealed several design implications for the roles and capabilities of a social drone, in addition to promising research directions for the development and design in the novel area of drones in education.}

A taxonomy for AR in HRI has recently been proposed for the field. However, it was limited to the definition of the framework, and exemplifying its use was missing. In this paper, we perform a demonstration of how the aforementioned taxonomy of AR in HRI can be used to analyse an existing AR-HRI system and come up with questions for alternative ways AR-HRI could be designed and further extended.}

  abstract={Social robots are increasingly being used as a mediator in robot-assisted autism therapy to improve children's social and cognitive skills. Engagement is one of the key measurements used to evaluate the therapeutic interventions' effect on children. While "engagement'' is broadly used, it has been challenging to find a consensus about its definition in the community. With this paper, we explore the use of a data-driven approach to investigate the extent to which a model on engagement built on one dataset transfers to another. We utilized two publicly available datasets of engagement recognition, namely PInSoRo and Qamqor datasets, with an attempt to achieve a higher accuracy taking into account the transferred knowledge. The accuracy of $83.18%$ was obtained on the PInSoRo dataset of child-child interactions with face and body keypoints. We have used the methodology of transfer learning to improve the classification accuracy on the Qamqor dataset. The best result obtained is a 71.89% accuracy on the Qamqor dataset. This suggests that more data with similar keypoints is needed to achieve better accuracy when utilizing transfer learning from one dataset to another dataset.}

abstract = {This year's conference theme "HRI for all" not just raises the importance of reflecting on how to promote inclusion for every type of user but also calls for careful consideration of the different layers of people potentially impacted by such systems. In educational setups, for instance, the users to be considered first and foremost are the learners. However, teachers, school directors, therapists and parents also form a more secondary layer of users in this ecosystem. The 7th edition of R4L focuses on the issues that HRI experiments in educational environments may cause to stakeholders and how we could improve on bringing the stakeholders' point of view into the loop. This goal is expected to be achieved in a very practical and dynamic way by the means of: (i) lightening talks from the participants; (ii) two discussion panels with special guests: One with active researchers from academia and industry about their experience and point of view regarding the inclusion of stakeholders; another panel with teacher, school directors, and parents that are/were involved in HRI experiments and will share their viewpoint; (iii) semi-structured group discussions and hands-on activities with participants and panellists to evaluate and propose guidelines for good practices regarding how to promote the inclusion of stakeholders, especially teachers, in educational HRI activities. By acquiring the viewpoint from the experimenters and stakeholders and analysing them in the same workshop, we expect to identify current gaps, propose practical solutions to bridge these gaps, and capitalise on existing synergies with the collective intelligence of the two communities.},

abstract="Education is one of the predominant applications that is foreseen by researchers in social roboticsSocial robotics. In this context, social robots are often designed to interact with one or several learners and with teachers. While educational scenarios for social robots have been studied widely, with experiments being conducted in several countries for nearly 20Â years, the cultural impact of accepting social robots in classrooms is still unclear. In this paper, we review the literature on social robots for education with the lens of cultural sensitivity and adaptation. We discuss culture theories and their application in social roboticsSocial robotics and highlight research gaps in terms of culture-sensitive design and cultural adaptation in social robots assisting learners in terms of (1) the robot's role, (2) envisioned tasks, and (3) interaction types. We also present guidelines for designing cross-cultural robots and culturally adaptive systems.",

abstract = {Task-specific training constitutes a core element for evidence-based rehabilitation strategies targeted at improving upper extremity activity after stroke. Its combination with additional treatment strategies and neurotechnology-based solutions could further improve patients' outcomes. Here, we studied the effect of gamified robot-assisted upper limb motor training on motor performance, skill learning, and transfer with respect to a non-gamified control condition with a group of chronic stroke survivors. The results suggest that a gamified training strategy results in more controlled motor performance during the training phase, which is characterized by a higher accuracy (lower deviance), higher smoothness (lower jerk), but slower speed. The responder analyses indicated that mildly impaired patients benefited most from the gamification approach. In conclusion, gamified robot-assisted motor training, which is personalized to the individual capabilities of a patient, constitutes a promising investigational strategy for further improving motor performance after a stroke.}
