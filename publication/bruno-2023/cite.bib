 abstract = {Education is one of the predominant applications that is foreseen by researchers in social roboticsSocial robotics. In this context, social robots are often designed to interact with one or several learners and with teachers. While educational scenarios for social robots have been studied widely, with experiments being conducted in several countries for nearly 20Â years, the cultural impact of accepting social robots in classrooms is still unclear. In this paper, we review the literature on social robots for education with the lens of cultural sensitivity and adaptation. We discuss culture theories and their application in social roboticsSocial robotics and highlight research gaps in terms of culture-sensitive design and cultural adaptation in social robots assisting learners in terms of (1) the robot's role, (2) envisioned tasks, and (3) interaction types. We also present guidelines for designing cross-cultural robots and culturally adaptive systems.},
