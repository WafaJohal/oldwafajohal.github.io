 abstract = {This study reviews published scientific literature on the use of swarm robots for education purposes in the last ten years. It focuses on user studies involving robotics swarm in order to identify the potential contributions of the incorporation of swarm robots as an educational tool and insight future research. We consider here the appearance of swarm robots, the curriculum of the experimental task and the interaction modalities between learners and robots. The outcomes of the literature review are discussed in terms of their existing challenges and opportunities for guiding researchers, educators, and practitioners.},
